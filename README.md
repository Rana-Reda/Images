# Images
In this project i introduced how to work with images.
We all have these kind of applications for editing images, suppose you want to get the gray version of an image you have, easy, scroll to your editing application, select your image, select gray and then save it. so simple isn't it?
Now imagine you want to convert 100 or 1000 images, would you do this for a 100 or a 1000 times? isn't easy at all.
So here in my project i made a simple program to do this task for you in a single second.
and not just converting into gray but any other operation you want to do over your images.
